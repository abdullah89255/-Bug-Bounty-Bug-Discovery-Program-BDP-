# -Bug-Bounty-Bug-Discovery-Program-BDP-
To start working on a **Bug Bounty / Bug Discovery Program (BDP)** ‚Äî often referred to as **bug hunting** ‚Äî you'll need a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step **beginner-to-advanced roadmap** to help you get started and become successful in the field.

## üî∞ STEP 1: **Understand Bug Bounty Basics**

### ‚úÖ What is Bug Hunting?

Bug hunting is finding and responsibly reporting security vulnerabilities in websites, applications, or systems in exchange for **rewards** or **recognition**.

### ‚úÖ Platforms Offering Bug Bounties

* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/)
* [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/)
* [Synack](https://synack.com/)
* [Intigriti](https://intigriti.com/)
* [YesWeHack](https://yeswehack.com/)
* [Open Bug Bounty](https://openbugbounty.org/)
* [Zerocopter](https://zerocopter.com/)
* Private programs (via responsible disclosure policies)

## üß∞ STEP 2: **Build Your Toolkit**

### ‚úÖ Essential Tools:

| Category              | Tools Example                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reconnaissance        | `Amass`, `Subfinder`, `Assetfinder`, `Waybackurls`         |
| Scanning              | `Nmap`, `httpx`, `Naabu`, `Shodan`                         |
| Vulnerability Testing | `Nuclei`, `Burp Suite`, `FFUF`, `SQLmap`, `Xray`, `Dalfox` |
| Source Inspection     | `JSParser`, `LinkFinder`, `SecretFinder`                   |
| Automation            | `GF`, `Hakrawler`, `Qsreplace`, `KXSS`                     |

Install them in Kali Linux or a VM to keep your setup isolated.

## üß† STEP 3: **Learn Common Vulnerabilities**

Start with these OWASP Top 10:

1. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
2. **SQL Injection**
3. **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**
4. **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**
5. **LFI/RFI (File Inclusions)**
6. **Open Redirect**
7. **Authentication/Authorization Issues**
8. **Information Disclosure**
9. **Clickjacking**
10. **Command Injection**

üõ† Practice on:

* [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/)
* [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)
* [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
* [VulnHub](https://vulnhub.com/)
* DVWA, Juice Shop, bWAPP (offline vulnerable apps)

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è STEP 4: **Target Reconnaissance**

Use automation and manual hunting to gather intel:

```bash
subfinder -d target.com -o subs.txt
httpx -l subs.txt -o live.txt
nuclei -l live.txt -t cves/
```

More advanced:

* Enumerate JS files, hidden params
* Use `gau`, `waybackurls` for old endpoints
* Use `Burp Suite` for intercepting requests

---

## üìù STEP 5: **Reporting Bugs Properly**

1. **Include**: Summary, steps to reproduce, impact, and PoC (Proof of Concept)
2. **Be Professional**: Write clearly and responsibly.
3. **Don‚Äôt Spam**: Submitting duplicates or low-quality reports can get you banned.
4. **Respect Scope**: Only test systems listed in the program scope.

Example (simplified):

```
Summary: Reflected XSS in /search?q= parameter
Steps:
1. Go to https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>
2. See alert box

Impact: Attacker can execute JS in user‚Äôs browser.

PoC: [insert screenshot or video]
```

## üß≠ STEP 6: **Stay Updated & Learn**

* Follow top bug hunters on Twitter/X
* Read write-ups: [HackerOne Hacktivity](https://hackerone.com/hacktivity), Medium blogs
* Join communities: Discords, Telegram groups, Reddit `r/bugbounty`
* Watch:

  * NahamSec (YouTube/Twitch)
  * InsiderPhD
  * Live hacking videos

---

## üí∏ Bonus: Earning Potential

* Beginner: \$0‚Äì\$500/month
* Intermediate: \$500‚Äì\$2,000/month
* Pro: \$5,000+/month or full-time career

---

## üöÄ Tips to Level Up Faster

* Automate repetitive tasks with bash/python
* Use `tmux` or `screen` for session management
* Build your own recon script
* Develop strong Google Dorking and OSINT skills
* Be consistent: Hunt daily or weekly
